# What is the impact of EV TOU Rebate on EV Sales in Maryland


# Introduction

With almost a third of CO2 emissions in Maryland generated by cars
reducing these emissions is crucial for the state’s climate goals
(“Department of the Environment”). A significant barrier to widespread
electric vehicle (EV) adoption, however, is the cost. Time-of-Use (TOU)
rebates, which incentivize EV owners to charge during off-peak hours,
offer a strategic approach to lowering the operational costs of EV
ownership. Maryland has implemented TOU rebates to encourage residents
to charge their vehicles when electricity is cheaper, easing grid strain
and making EVs more affordable. This research investigates the impact of
Maryland’s TOU rebates on EV adoption, aiming to assess the program’s
effectiveness. By understanding this relationship, Maryland policymakers
can enhance rebate programs and serve as a model for other states. This
approach supports the accelerated transition to EVs, reduction in
emissions, and advancement of clean energy goals nationwide.

# Literature Review

Many states, like Maryland, strive to reduce emissions from the
transportation sector. To accelerate EV adoption, one policy approach is
the implementation of Time-of-Use (TOU) rebates. Significant research,
such as Bailey et al. (2024), discusses the implications of
electricity rate designs—particularly TOU rates—on EV adoption. Bailey et al. (2024)
find that TOU rates can incentivize EV owners to charge during
off-peak hours, making EVs more affordable. However, the study
highlights some issues; for instance, higher-income households are more
likely to own EVs and thus benefit more from the pricing incentive.

While the NBER study provides insights into how TOU pricing works in
general, it does not focus on specific states, such as Maryland. Our
research addresses this gap by examining how Maryland’s TOU rebate
program impacts EV sales within the state. By focusing on Maryland, we
can better assess whether the rebate program is effectively helping
residents adopt EVs. Additionally, unlike Bailey et al. (2024), our research
will consider factors such as gas prices, which may further influence EV
adoption. Thus, our study aims to provide a more localized analysis of
Maryland’s TOU rebates and their effect on EV sales.

# Data Description

The frequency of the data frame is monthly and the cross-sectional
(geographical) unit is electric company. 

The treated group consists of electric vehicle (EV) sales associated with the Baltimore Gas & Electric Co. (BGE) during the Time-of-Use (TOU) rebate period starting July 2021. These sales are impacted by the implementation of the TOU rebate. The untreated group includes EV sales under both the Baltimore Gas & Electric Co. (BGE) and Potomac Electric Power Co. (Pepco) before the TOU rebate period, and those for Pepco throughout the study, as they were not subject to the TOU rebate during the treatment window.

The dataset used in this study includes monthly records from two major electric companies in Maryland—Baltimore Gas & Electric Co (BGE) and Potomac Electric Power Co (Pepco). BGE is subject to a Time-of-Use (TOU) pricing structure, which incentivizes electric vehicle (EV) owners to charge during off-peak hours when electricity is cheaper. This TOU pricing mechanism effectively lowers operational costs for EVs and helps manage grid demand. In contrast, Pepco does not offer a TOU pricing plan, allowing for a comparison between regions with and without such incentives. By differentiating between these pricing models, the study can assess the impact of TOU rebates on EV adoption across different electric facilities in Maryland.

The below code shows the two electric companies that we will focusing
on:

``` r
table(df$Company)
```


    Baltimore Gas & Electric Co   Potomac Electric Power Co 
                             50                          50 

The below code displays all the variables (column) in the dataframe:

``` r
names(df) 
```

    [1] "Date"        "Company"     "EVs"         "EVTOURebate"

The treatment variable of interest is TOU Time x BGE and the outcome
variable of interest is EVs.

Here we are focusing on Pepco and BGE:

Below is a boxplot that visualizes the distribution of the outcome
variable under treatment and no treatment.

Let’t say we want to calculate the predicted value of the outcome

# Discussion of Our Results

Our research on Maryland’s Time-of-Use (TOU) rebate program reveals that
TOU rebates significantly contributed to the growth of electric vehicle
(EV) sales in the state. From mid-2021 to late 2023, TOU rebates were
directly responsible for the sale of approximately 6,000 EVs,
representing nearly 14% of the 45,000 EVs sold during this period.

 A comparative analysis using box plots demonstrated a notable
difference in EV sales with and without TOU rebates: sales doubled from
5,000 to 10,000 when TOU rebates were applied. 

This clear contrast underscores the effectiveness of TOU rebates in
increasing EV adoption by reducing operational costs. Maryland
policymakers can leverage these insights to enhance rebate programs,
potentially setting a precedent for similar initiatives in other regions
to drive EV adoption and support emission reduction goals.

# Future Plans

1.  **Analyze the Impact of Gas Price Differences on EV Sales:**
    Investigate how fluctuations in gas prices between different fuel
    companies influence EV sales, potentially highlighting how rising
    gas prices may further encourage EV adoption among consumers.
2.  **Compare Used Car Prices in Different Regions:** Examine the
    variation in used car prices between the Potomac and Baltimore areas
    to understand regional price disparities and how these might affect
    consumer decisions between purchasing EVs versus traditional
    vehicles.
3.  **Assess Pre-July 2021 EV Dealership Sales Trends:** Conduct a
    historical analysis of EV sales trends at dealerships before July
    2021 to identify patterns or shifts in consumer interest and
    evaluate if early adoption behaviors differ from recent trends
    influenced by TOU rebates.

# Causal Graph

![](images/causal_graph.png)

Here, our project mainly considered the impact (and therefore government
incentives) on EV Sales. However, there were some other factors that
impact EV Sales that we can incorporate into future studies as well.
Situations involving gas prices and EV dealership availability across
counties heavily impact consumer behavior, which ultimately is another
very important factor when considering EV sales. Furthermore, we haven’t
completely explored the other effects of government incentives in
relation to EV sales. Government policies on dealership availability
(during the COVID period) and charging infrastructure availability also
impact EV sales. In the future, looking deeper into these elements and
how they impact each other can help us better understand EV sales.
