# Introduction:

With almost a third of CO2 emissions in Maryland generated by cars reducing these emissions is crucial for the state’s climate goals (“Department of the Environment”). A significant barrier to widespread electric vehicle (EV) adoption, however, is the cost. Time-of-Use (TOU) rebates, which incentivize EV owners to charge during off-peak hours, offer a strategic approach to lowering the operational costs of EV ownership. Maryland has implemented TOU rebates to encourage residents to charge their vehicles when electricity is cheaper, easing grid strain and making EVs more affordable. This research investigates the impact of Maryland’s TOU rebates on EV adoption, aiming to assess the program’s effectiveness. By understanding this relationship, Maryland policymakers can enhance rebate programs and serve as a model for other states. This approach supports the accelerated transition to EVs, reduction in emissions, and advancement of clean energy goals nationwide.

# Literature Review:

Many states, like Maryland, strive to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. To accelerate EV adoption, one policy approach is the implementation of Time-of-Use (TOU) rebates. Significant research, such as Electric Vehicles and the Energy Transition: Unintended Consequences of a Common Retail Rate Design by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER, 2024), discusses the implications of electricity rate designs—particularly TOU rates—on EV adoption. The NBER study finds that TOU rates can incentivize EV owners to charge during off-peak hours, making EVs more affordable. However, the study highlights some issues; for instance, higher-income households are more likely to own EVs and thus benefit more from the pricing incentive.

While the NBER study provides insights into how TOU pricing works in general, it does not focus on specific states, such as Maryland. Our research addresses this gap by examining how Maryland’s TOU rebate program impacts EV sales within the state. By focusing on Maryland, we can better assess whether the rebate program is effectively helping residents adopt EVs. Additionally, unlike the NBER study, our research will consider factors such as gas prices, which may further influence EV adoption. Thus, our study aims to provide a more localized analysis of Maryland’s TOU rebates and their effect on EV sales.

```{r}
df<-read.csv("panel.csv")
```

The table below shows the first ten observations of our data frame.

```{r}
kable(head(df))
```

The frequency of the data frame is monthly and the cross-sectional (geographical) unit is electric company.

```{r}
table(df$Company)
```

```{r}
names(df) 
```

The treatment variable of interest is TOU Time x BGE and the outcome variable of interest is EVs.

Map of Pepco and BGE:

A boxplot that visualizes the distribution of the outcome variable under treatment and no treatment.

```{r}

ggplot(df, aes(x=as.Date(Date), y=EVs, col=Company)) + geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept=as.Date(as.Date("2021-07-01")), col="pink", linetype="dashed", lwd=1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=as.Date(as.Date("2022-11-01")), col="lightblue", linetype="dashed", lwd=1) +
  theme_bw()
```

The regression model $y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$ where $y$ is the outcome variable and $x$ is the treatment variable. Below are our results:

```{r}
df2<-df %>%
  mutate(BGE = ifelse(Company == "Baltimore Gas & Electric Co", 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(TOU_time=ifelse(as.Date(Date)>as.Date("2021-07-01"),1,0))

model1<-lm(EVs ~ TOU_time * BGE + as.factor(Date), data=df2)

summary(model1)
```

## Question 5: What is the predicted value of the outcome variable when treatment=0?

Answer: 7900

## Question 6: What is predicted value of the outcome variable when treatment=1?

Answer: 7900 + 27954 + 3223 + 6332 = 45,419

## Question 7: What is the equation that describes the linear regression above? Please include an explanation of the variables and subscripts.

Answer: $ev_{ct} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 TOUTime_{t} + \beta_2 BGE_{c} + \beta3TOU_{c}*BGE_{t} + \alpha_{Date} + \epsilon_{ct}$

## Question 8: What fixed effects can be included in the regression? What does each fixed effects control for? Please include a new equation that incorporates the fixed effects.

Answer: Date fix effects

## Question 9: What is the impact of the treatment effect once fixed effects are included?

Answer: 6332 EVs

# Questions for Week 5

## Question 10: What are the next steps of your research?

Take into account-

1.  difference in gas prices between both companies
2.  difference in used car prices between Potomac area and Baltimore area
3.  EV dealerships being before July 2021

Step 9: Change the document format to gfm

Step 10: Save this document as README.qmd

Step 11: Render the document. README.md file should be created after this process.

Step 12: Push the document back to GitHub and observe your beautiful document in your repository!

Step 13: If your team has a complete dataframe that includes both the treated and outcome variable, you are done with the assignment. If not, make a research plan in Notion to collect data on the outcome and treatment variable and combine it into one dataframe.
