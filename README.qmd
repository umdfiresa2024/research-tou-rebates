Step 1. Install necessary packages.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("kableExtra")
```

Step 2. Declare that you will use these packages in this session.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library("tidyverse")
library("kableExtra")
```

Step 3. Upload the dataframe that you have created in Spring 2024 into the repository.

Step 4. Open the dataframe into the RStudio Environment.

```{r}
df<-read.csv("panel.csv")
```

Step 5. Use the **head** and **kable** function showcase the first 10 rows of the dataframe to the reader.

```{r}
kable(head(df))
```

## Question 1: What is the frequency of this data frame?

Answer: monthly

## Question 2: What is the cross-sectional (geographical) unit of this data frame?

Answer: Electric company

```{r}
table(df$Company)
```

Step 6. Use the **names** function to display all the variables (column) in the dataframe.

```{r}
names(df) 

intsub<-c("Baltimore Gas null zone - PJM", 
          "Delmarva Power null zone - PJM", 
          "Potomac Electric Power zone - PJM")

df2<-df %>%
   mutate(date=as.Date(date), dow=weekdays(date)) %>%
  mutate(BGE_rebate=ifelse(subba.name=="Baltimore Gas null zone - PJM" & year>=2021 & (month>=6 & month<=9) & (hour>=10 & hour<=20),
                            1, 0)) %>%
    mutate(BGE_rebate=ifelse(subba.name=="Baltimore Gas null zone - PJM" & year>=2021 & (month>=10) & (hour>=7 & hour<=11),1, BGE_rebate)) %>%
      mutate(BGE_rebate=ifelse(subba.name=="Baltimore Gas null zone - PJM" & year>=2021 & (month<=5) & (hour>=7 & hour<=11),1, BGE_rebate)) %>%
      mutate(BGE_rebate=ifelse(subba.name=="Baltimore Gas null zone - PJM" & year>=2021 & (month>=10) & (hour>=17 & hour<=21),1, BGE_rebate)) %>%
    mutate(BGE_rebate=ifelse(subba.name=="Baltimore Gas null zone - PJM" &year>=2021 & (month<=5) & (hour>=17 & hour<=21),1, BGE_rebate)) %>%
   mutate(Delmarva_rebate=ifelse(subba.name=="Delmarva Power null zone - PJM" &date>as.Date("2019-11-01") & (hour>=12 & hour<=20) & (dow == "Monday" | dow == "Tuesday" | dow == "Wednesday" |dow == "Thursday" | dow=="Friday"),1, 0)) %>%
   mutate(Potomac_rebate=ifelse(subba.name=="Potomac Electric Power zone - PJM" & year>=2020  & (hour>=7 & hour<=20),1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(subba.name=ifelse(subba.name %in% intsub, subba.name, "Other")) %>%
  group_by(subba.name, hour, month, year, date, dow, BGE_rebate, Delmarva_rebate, Potomac_rebate) %>%
summarise(value=sum(value, rm.na=TRUE))
  

#write.csv(df2, "panel.csv", row.names = F)  
```

## Question 3: Which column represents the treatment variable of interest?

Answer: BGE_rebate, Delmarva_rebate, Potomac_rebate

## Question 4: Which column represents the outcome variable of interest?

Answer: value (which represents energy consumption in Mw)

Step 7: Create a boxplot to visualize the distribution of the outcome variable under treatment and no treatment.

```{r}
#| eval: false

df_long <- df2 %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(BGE_rebate, Delmarva_rebate, Potomac_rebate),
               names_to = "rebate_type",
               values_to = "rebate_status")

# Create the box plot
ggplot(df_long %>% filter(rebate_status == 1), aes(x = rebate_type, y = value, fill = rebate_type)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Energy Consumption by Rebate Type", 
       x = "Rebate Type", 
       y = "Energy Consumption (Mw)") +
  theme_minimal()



#ggplot(df2, aes(x=)) +
  #geom_histogram() +
  #facet_wrap(~nbp)

#boxplot(df$)
```

Step 8: Fit a regression model $y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$ where $y$ is the outcome variable and $x$ is the treatment variable. Use the **summary** function to display the results.

```{r}
model1<-lm(value ~ BGE_rebate + Delmarva_rebate + Potomac_rebate + as.factor(dow) + 
             as.factor(hour) + as.factor(month) + as.factor(month):as.factor(hour), data=df2)

summary(model1)
```

## Question 5: What is the predicted value of the outcome variable when treatment=0?

Answer:

## Question 6: What is predicted value of the outcome variable when treatment=1?

Answer:

## Question 7: What is the equation that describes the linear regression above? Please include an explanation of the variables and subscripts.

Answer:

## Question 8: What fixed effects can be included in the regression? What does each fixed effects control for? Please include a new equation that incorporates the fixed effects.

Answer:

## Question 9: What is the impact of the treatment effect once fixed effects are included?

Answer:

# Questions for Week 5

## Question 10: In a difference-in-differences (DiD) model, what is the treatment GROUP?

Answer:

## Question 11: In a DiD model, what are the control groups?

Answer:

## Question 12: What is the DiD regression equation that will answer your research question?

## Question 13: Run your DiD regressions below. What are the results of the DiD regression?

## Question 14: What are the next steps of your research?

Step 9: Change the document format to gfm

Step 10: Save this document as README.qmd

Step 11: Render the document. README.md file should be created after this process.

Step 12: Push the document back to GitHub and observe your beautiful document in your repository!

Step 13: If your team has a complete dataframe that includes both the treated and outcome variable, you are done with the assignment. If not, make a research plan in Notion to collect data on the outcome and treatment variable and combine it into one dataframe.
